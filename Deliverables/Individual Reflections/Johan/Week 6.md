#### What do I want to learn or understand better? 

------

**Now:**  
Having worked under pressures has highlighted some things. For example it has highlighted the need of code review and the hardships that come with not being available at the same place. The sprint was completed but I feel that I learned more about how different group members like to work and communicate. 

**Next and How: **  
Forthcoming I want to become better at using the KPIs that we have implemented. I also want to improve at using code reviewing and at keeping value creation in mind during creation of tasks and user stories. Also, to ensure that the project turns out as a single product, not as multiple stitched together parts. 

#### How can I help someone or the team to learn something new? 

-------
I can help my team to learn new things by doing code reviews and keeping in mind to create content and to communicate more with my group members. 

------

#### What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum? 

Reviewing code and participating in meeting, although this week I was quite busy with my other course and naturally didn't have time to help out as I have contributed by discussing what adds value to the project and by having communicated whenever I got stuck or finished early. I have also contributed by using the scrum board and the shared resources while I was completing and testing the tasks I finished. 

Additionally, I have help by applying the scrum estimation procedure and by participating in daily meetings and having used the communication channels set up. 

-------

#### What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

Writing the team documents and participating in meetings. Code wise I have focused mainly on discussing code and trying to be available as much as possible.

#### What do I want to learn or understand better? 

------

**Now:**  
Currently, I have a better understanding of how our group works, the estimates and the project methodology. I have also become better at accurately estimating the time a user story takes although it's still difficult due to the lack of experience within the web programming. 

**Next and How: **  
Next I want to see how the group is affected while working under stricter time limits and how this is taken into account during the sprint planning phase. To do this I will communicate with the group and we can together carefully weigh the estimates and the velocity for this week to still achieve a good sprint. 

------

#### How can I help someone or the team to learn something new?

#### What do I want to learn or understand better? 

------

**Now:**  
I now have a greater ability to create and estimate user stories. I have also talked to the group and divided the tasks more appropriately after skill and interests.  

My low experience in stack development still makes estimating project tasks hard.  I am also still unused to applying the scrum methodology, including task and user-story creation, the Definition of Done as well as using a tool like git for version control. 

**Next:**    
Next I need to work more with the project to gather experience and in that way improve my ability to estimate the tasks. I also want to get more accustomed to work with and how to apply/use the scrum methodology in a group that works best for me.

**How:**  
Keep in mind and strive to apply the scrum methodologies when working on the tasks. Work more tightly together with group members to learn how scrum applies in practice.  

------

#### How can I help someone or the team to learn something new? 

-------

I can contribute to the team effort by discussing the sprint experience. Another way to improve our learning is to read up on material and help group members using feedback. I can also help the group by together exploring different work methods and different usages of the scrum board, including tasks, testing, acceptance criteria and so on. Lastly, I can help the group learn about what a good task is by sharing my experience from the sprint while planning the next sprint and creating/estimating new tasks.

-------

#### What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum? 

So far I have helped creating the user stories and tasks. Furthermore, I have estimated the tasks and worked on them in collaboration with other developers to experience the scrum methods. I have also participated in daily meetings and helped writing the reflection and review documents. 

For the next sprint I will together with the team update the user stories and tasks as well as manage the scrum board. I will also try new estimating and promote working in subgroups since that was a good experience from this sprint. I will also try to promote the nice and positive group culture. 

-------

#### What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? 

I helped discuss and write the scrum review and together with the team. I have also participated in the meetings to discuss the tasks and user stories. Lastly, I have worked together in a close team to write code and complete the tasks I had taken on for this sprint.

**Now:**  
I have now experienced my first real sprint as well as created and estimated the tasks. We as a group have also experienced working on the project and had our first discussion with the stake holder.

-----

**Next:**  
Next I want to improve my ability to create and estimate user stories and tasks. This, mainly to improve efficiency. Additionally, regarding the project, I want to better understand the stake holder's needs and how to create a user interface that is attractive and efficient / non-distractive for the product. 

**How:**  
Discuss with the group and listen to other's experiences regarding task estimation. I can also try to estimate based on my previous experience.   
To better understand the stake holder's needs we will discuss the feedback internally. The goal is here to find design changes that are well-supported by the feedback received. 

------

#### How can I help someone or the team to learn something new? 

-------

I can help the team by contributing with knowledge from my course in web-development in Hong Kong. Further on, we as a group can together learn how to do "distance-work" and how to we as a team work together and what reasonable estimates should be for tasks and user stories. 

-------

#### What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
